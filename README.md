# Virtual Clinic
### about
***Virtual Clinic*** 
is an online clinic to connect patients and doctors (providers) remotely, via an application that allows real-time interaction between the patient and the doctor.

The project's MVP is to create an interface for the Patient, Provider and Manager to be able to register a patient, schedule an appointment, assist the patient via a video conference (Telemedicine).

The language used is `C#`, with `Entityframework`, `razor and JavaScript FrontEnd, Bootstrap and FontAwesome Icons libaries` and others.
